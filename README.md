# Installation

This library depends on the "dot" binary being installed. It comes as part of the ["graphviz"](https://graphviz.org/download/) 
set of tools.

On a Mac you can install this with `brew install graphviz`. See the [graphviz page](https://graphviz.org/download/) for 
installation instructions for other operating systems.
